# SMF9 Website
My website made in some shitty NodeJS lol. I used Portal Miiverse CSS from <a href="https://github.com/ArianKordi/grape/">Grape</a>, a Miiverse Clone made by Arian Kordi. Actually uh, I guess I'll make it open-source. I'm also pretty novice.

# Anything else?
~~Nope, it's all good.~~

Nevermind. I'm using Apache License 2.0 which means you can use the code but not the assets. Also, I didn't finish the website yet so I do not recommend you to go and use it (even when it's going to be finished i recommend you to not lmfao). There are missing HTML files, plus I'm really bad at NodeJS lol.
